This is my project repo for DS6021, where I am analyzing brain data using a variety of machine learning methods

It is important to note that because I am under NDA, the data here is simulation data, and the data I will display in the presentation is the real work.

https://ds6021.onrender.com here is the web app. Unfortunately, the data is too large to actually run on a web server without paying money, but the app file
works on any machine with greater than 500 mb of memory (512 mb to be exact)


Slides: ML1Proj.pdf

Data: Simulated_data folder

Compiled code: all other files
